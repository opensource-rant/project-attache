# Attache
Attach√© offers a platform for crafting unique products from recycled plastics sourced from Samsara Eco. Our debut items include 3D printed bouldering holds for climbing gyms. By modeling everyday objects in a 3D environment, they become customizable bouldering problems. These puzzle pieces can be 3D printed and supplied to climbing gyms. Classes will be available to teach students the process, inspiring their own design projects. Our mission goes beyond recycling materials; we're dedicated to upholding the company's founding principle of sustainability. Join us in creating an eco-friendly future through innovative design solutions.
